#UCF Header v2.0.0 (working demo)

Simple working demo of the future UCF Header (the "black bar").


## Goals
* A refreshed look
* Remove unused, unnecessary tools such as the "Quicklinks" dropdown; provide easily accessible links to common UCF applications while maintaining a navigational structure that does not conflict with other UCF sites
* Faster, Lighter, Harder, Better, Stronger -- lightweight code with no jQuery dependencies or other external libraries. Rely on hardware-accelerated technologies (CSS3 transitions, etc) for fancy effects; keep the rendering javascript to a minimum.
* Responsive -- match Bootstrap 2.x's responsive breakpoints for seamless integration with many other projects. Make the bar mobile-friendly.
* Search as you type -- more intuitive searching; combine a set list of common key terms and search results via the UCF search service.
